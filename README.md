# Infrared-Analysis-of-Blood-Serum-with-Machine-Learning
This project explores the application of Two-Dimensional Infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy combined with machine learning for protein secondary structure analysis. It evaluates models such as linear regression, kernel ridge regression, SVMs, and neural networks to predict α-helix and β-sheet content.
